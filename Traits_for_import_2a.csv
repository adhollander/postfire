Adenostoma fasciculatum,Chamise chaparral,"Sprouter, seeder","Seeder, poor_sprouter",Sprouter,NA,Seeder,Seeder,"(1) 90% seeds germinated postfire (RCD) (although negatively correlated with regeneration from lignotubers owing to competition from resprouts (Stohlgren et al. 1989 in RCD). (2)   Postfire:  establishment of large numbers of seedlings from fire-activated, soil stored seeds (FEIS refs 16, 68 9,74,120). (3) Flush of initial seedling establishment immediately following fire, but subsequent mortality is quite high [FEIS 59,73,85]. Degree seedlings contribute to postfire recover depends on site characteristics, fire mortality of adults, and stand age (FEIS), (4) In arid southern CA seedlings stronger than sprouting (FEIS  56,58,71,72,136], although on north aspects sprouting stronger (EU: note comment under sprouting vigor)","1) Sprouts from lignotubers.  Postfire: vigorous sprout production  (FEIS refs 16, 68 9,74,120). (2)  sprouting is the predominant mode of postfire regeneration at higher elevations in southern California mountains [FEIS 71,73,129

Salvia mellifera,Black sage scrub,"Seeder, sprouter",Seeder,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(1) Relative frequency of seeding v. sprouting varies among sites and may be tied to the density of vegetation and intensity of fire:  Keeley (1986) reported that in dense, interior populations, shrubs tend to be killed by fire and depend more on seedling recruitment (RCD). (2) Postfire it is also establishes abundant seedlings. (3) seeding more common in interior v. coastal/maritime sites (Westman et al. FEIS) from soil-stored seed [FEIS 13,20].","(1) Low in interior sites as more adult mortality with fire in interior populations as species denser. (2) sprouting by producing adventitious roots along decumbent branches [14,58] and rejuvenate their canopies through the new basal sprouts from epicormic buds at the stem base [32, FEIS]. (3) sprouting potential of coastal sage scrub species is generally lower on interior sites v. coastal/maritime sites (Westman et al. in FEIS). (4) after higher severity fires usually a nonsprouter and relies on the previously dormant seed bank for rapid postburn establishment [FEIS 21,24,62]."
Eriodictyon crassifolium,Yerba santa,"Sprouter, seeder","Sprouter, seeder",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seedlings emerge in winter rainy season after fire (Went et al. 1952, Keeley et al. 2006) and also in absence of fire (RCD). Early seedling mortality is high but surviving seedlings grow rapidly.  Postfire: plants recolonize from seed (Went et al. 1952, Vogl & Schorr 1972, Keeley et al. 2006) or from sprouting rhizomes after fire;  87% of plants resprouted and most seed germination occurred within the first two years following fire (data grouped for E. trichocalyx and E. crassifolium, keeley 2006 study). Fire stimulates seed germination (heat, smoke, Keeley et al. 2005).","Postfire shoots sprout from an extensive system of shallow rhizomes (Hellmers et al. 1955, Keeley in RCD)"
Eriogonum fasciculatum,California buckwheat,"Seeder, poor_sprouter",seeder  ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Regenerating from seeds more frequent v. sprouting (RCD). Germination of untreated, filled seeds averages about 70% under cool winter temperatures and natural light (RCD); 71% seedlings emerged in the 1st yr postfire, 21% in 2nd, dropping to 5% and lower in subsequent years","It rarely sprouts, but can  after fire, but most shrub regeneration is from buried seed (Keeley 1998a in MCV)"
Artemisa californica,California sagebrush,"Sprouter, seeder","Sprouting, very_poor_seeder",Sprouter,Sprouter,"Sprouter, seeder",Sprouter,"Seeds germinate in canopy openings, small grassland clearings generated by gophers, but seedlings suffer high mortality from gopher activity or after fire (Eliason & Allen 1997, DeSimone & Zedler 1999, 2001).Postfire: plants regenerate after fire by both spouting and from seedlings (Keeley 1998, Keeley et al. 2006), however seedling emergence post-fire is variable and low (Zedler et al. 1983, Keeley 1998 in RCD): CA sagebrush resprouted after fire about 20% of the time within inland areas and 18%in coastal areas in lg CA study (Keeley et al. 2006) (note high herbivory from small mammals and exotic comp).Seed survival after 1st year very low (FEIS).  Most seedlings est after rains in fall, and most growth complete before dry season (May, FEIS). Ave seed production greatest on south-facing slopes (Zedler & DiSimone in FEIS","CA sagebrush regeneration following fire is primarily via sprouting and rel rapid [108,160,204 in FEIS].
