Adenostoma fasciculatum,Chamise chaparral,high,"Extensive root system, drought resistance, and ability to grow in shallow or deep soils are important characteristics for use in revegetation, especially for slope restoration (Calscape 2017, in RCD)",high,53-100% stable,"Resprouting chamise provides forage (for mule deer, rabbits, dusky footed woodrats) on recently burned sites (McMurray 1990, in RCD).  Chamise also provides habitat and cover for nesting birds, mule deer, and many species of wildlife, including sensitive species (e.g., McMurray 1990). Open chamise scrub provides habitat for the orange-throated whiptail lizard (Cnemidophorus hyperythrus beldingi, Brattstom 2000), and the federally threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) nests in chamise in mixed coastal sage scrub, especially late in the season (Sockman 2000).",container only,"herbicide, watering","For plants installed in early winter, survival of 2-gallon sized container plants to ~13 months was signficantly higher for plots treated with both glyphosate (general herbicide) and fluazifob (kills grasses) than for control plots (all died) and plots treated with only fluazifob (Engel 2014). Plantings were hand watered with only 1 L of water once to twice a month. (2) Seeding with ryegrass (as is commonly done in so Cal inhibits growth of chaparral seedlings (FEIS, 33)
