Adenostoma fasciculatum,Chamise chaparral,3, 30-80,1,high,high,low,low-med,"(1) Sensitive: seedbank depletion and exhaustion of lignotubers (RCD, Zedler et al. 1984 within). Mortality patterns associated with fire frequency, Chamise is a fire-sensitive species [136], and mortality may be substantial following fire [54,74,105].  Perennating buds are located
just beneath the soil surface and are quite susceptible to fire damage. (2)  Chamise is extremely susceptible to short-interval fires,  high mortality of both seedlings and sprouts is likely when fires recur (FEIS 3,136];  (3) Fires occurring at very short intervals may completely eradicate postfire seedling reproduction if the soil seed reserve is not well established and reproductive maturity has not been reached [FEIS, 58,136]

","(1). Vulernable as high intensity delays sprouting (CMV). Increased fire intensity associated with increased mortality (small burls died, fewer sprout, longer time to sprouting (Moreno & Oechel 1991 in RCD) showed experimentally that increasing fire intensity is associated with an increasing mortality of chamise shrubs. Small burls died at higher rates than large burls, and the higher the fire intensity, the fewer sprouts and the longer the time to resprouting. (2.)  Chamise is a fire-sensitive species [136], and mortality may be substantial following fire [54,74,105, FEIS].  Perennating buds are located just beneath the soil surface and are quite susceptible to fire damage [3,136].

(2) Following higher severity chaparral fires, black sage is usually a nonsprouter and relies on the previously dormant seed bank for rapid postburn establishment [FEIS 21,24,62]. (3) Heat from fire may reduce seed germination rates (Keeley and Fotheringham 1998, in MCV). (4) Regenerates mostly from soil-stored seed after higher severity fire (Gordon and White 1994, Horton and Kraebel 1955, Keeley 1998b, McMurray 1990c, in MCV)
